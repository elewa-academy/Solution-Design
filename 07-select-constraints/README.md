#  --- Constraints

Place some interesting constraints on your solution, describe them in your README's "Constraints" section and say why you selected these.  

you may ask "why make my work harder?"
	good constraints help with successful & timely implementation  
	a way to understand the problem in new ways
	learn new things from old/easy problems
	practice dealing with common/reaslitic ocnstraints
	practice a particular technique or tool


A good first constraint:
think of your function as a return value factory
	- this will take some time
	initialize empty at top of function
	build solution it in stages
	return it at the end
	think of arguments as read-only

Possible more advanced constraints:
* Work with only certain language features
* Avoid certain language features
* Place a time limit on yourself
* Use a new library, like Lodash
* Write the fewest lines of code you can
* Make your function use the least number of steps possible (as measured by PythonTutor)
* ... and so many more!
