# Scaffold Your Solution


use gists
	create new file in gist for each new bit of scaffolding
try to isolate sets of test cases with your scaffolding
think of your function as a return value factory
	- this will take some time
	initialize empty at top of function
	build solution it in stages
	return it at the end
	think of arguments as read-only
steps
	function, args & return values


-- from old template --

Using plain sentences and pseudocode, explain the process you followed from reading the Codewar prompt to coding your final solution.  Describe what you were thinking at every step, how that step moved you forward (or backwards, note that too!), and provide a little pseudocode to illustrate each step.

This may feel tedious but we promise you it will pay off in the long run.  By paying attention to you thinking process you will start to notice what strategies work for you, which strategies you use too often, and where you struggle.  Even more importantly, writing out your process will help you generalize your problem solving skills - taking them from the world of coding small challenges to the world of application development.

If you find yourself getting stuck or having trouble understanding just what you're supposed to do, try taking a few simple examples inputs and solving them by hand.  This will make the problem more tangible and less abstract.  Be sure to include these manual solutions in your process description!

Stick with it!  It's best to learn how to analyze your thinking while the problems are simpler.  You don't want to be trying to understand a full project __and__ your problem solving style a the same time.
