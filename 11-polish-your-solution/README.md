# Polish Your Solution

Now that your solution passes all of the tests, it's time to put on the finishing touches and to include it in your repository.
1. Refactor it into something another developer will have no trouble understanding:
  * Check that your variable names are clear and helpful
  * Make sure your code is well-formatted
  * Double check that your strategy is easy to understand just from reading the source code
2. Paste it into "solution.js"
3. Fill out the "Language Features" section of your README
