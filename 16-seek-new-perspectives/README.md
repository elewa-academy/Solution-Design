# Seek New Perspectives

You've done the best you can, now ask someone else for their feedback.

1. Create a new folder in your repository call "code-reviews" and place a new copy of the [class code-review template](https://github.com/April-2018-Elewa-Academy/code-review-checklist/blob/master/0-first-checklist.md). 
2. Fill out the pre-review section.
3. Ask a friend to review your repo with an issue.
4. Accept their pull-request.
5. Fill out the post-review section
