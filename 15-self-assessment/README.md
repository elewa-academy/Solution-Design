# Self Assessment

Now that you've finished building your solution, look back on the process you just went through.  Write a "self-assessment.md" where you review what went well and what didn't go so well:
* How well did you estimate the time it would take?
* What major bugs did you encounter?
* Did you repeat any mistakes you'd made in previous projects?
* Do you wish you'd chosen a different solution strategy?
* How helpful were the test cases you chose?
* Were your constraints helpful? too restrictive? distracting?
* How well were you able to determine what to scaffold?

Include a section in your self-assessment with plans for how to improve your next CodeWars solution based on what you learned from this one.
