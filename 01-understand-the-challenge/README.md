# Understand the Challenge

Read and rephrase the challenge until you think you completely understand it. Be sure to pay careful attention to the wording from the specifications, and don't hesitate to look up any words you don't completely understand. 

Once you think you've got it, rewrite the challenge in your own words at the top of the template's README.  Also include the challenge as function specifications (name, args, return value, behavior).
