# Fill in the Gaps

If you did a good job scaffolding your solution all that should be left is to fill in isolated chunks of logic, and each chunk will likely be solving one classification of test case. Trust your scaffolding and treat each one as a completely separate problem. 

Choose one chunk at a time, and code it!  Be sure it passes all of it's tests before moving on the the next.

This process is very similar to Test Driven Development.  Practicing passing one set of tests at a time right now will make learning TDD much easier in the future.
