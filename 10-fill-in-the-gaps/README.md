# Fill in the Gaps

If you did a good job scaffolding your solution all that should be left is to fill in isolated chunks of logic, and each chunk will likely be solving one classification of test case. Trust your scaffolding and treat each one as a completely separate problem. 

Choose one chunk at a time, and code it!  
* Pass all tests from one chunk before moving on
* Include any interesting bugs you come across in your (De)bug-off notebook, either as challenges or as solutions
* Work in "solution.js" so you can run your tests directly in the browser

This process is very similar to Test Driven Development.  Practicing passing one set of tests at a time right now will make learning TDD much easier in the future.
