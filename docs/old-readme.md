# Codewars Gallery

> “ First, solve the problem. Then, write the code. ”  - _John Johnson_

In this project you will send you deep into [problem solving and thinking with code](http://elewa.education/2018/01/22/thinking-computer-thoughts/).  Rather than doing as many exercises as possible, you'll be doing an in-depth study of at least 10 exercises.  Pick katas that interest you, this will help you power through.  

Along the way you'll learn about reading code, testing, using pseudocode, analyzing problem solving strategies, the JavaScript runtime execution, and much more.   

To guid you through this process we've created a template repository for you to fork - once for each exercise.  For each repo you fork and each Kata you complete, you will have to:
* Code you favorite solution
* Explain your solution: strategy & language features
* Write test cases, at least 10
* Write 2+ more solutions in pseudocde
* Analyze the solution of 3+ other Codewar Ninjas
* Write specs for you function
* Walk through your solution with 2+ different inputs
  * Pay special attention to this task
* Notes what you learned, what was hard, and what's next
* (you can do these in whatever order works best for you)


If this looks like a lot, that's because it is.  Studying fewer problems in greater depth (and from many different angles) will lead to better _skill transfer_, better self-knowledge, and more dexterity when dealing directly with sourcecode.  

Don't forget to build a gallery page for your Kata Repos and to feature it on your portfolio!

## [JS Notional Machine](http://www.computacional.com.br/arquivos/Artigos%20CS%20Unplugged%20-%20Desplugado/SORVA%20-%20Notional%20Machines%20and%20Introductory%20Programming%20Education.pdf)


The __notional machine__ is a [mental model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K_sxBUGx8A) your brain builds to understand what JavaScript does during program execution.  These notional machines don't need to be precise down to the physical chips, instead they need to accurately describe what is relevant to the task at hand. At the beginning this list includes:
* How JS steps through a file
* Source code vs. runtime application
* Variable initialization & reassignment
* Functions: 
  * Definition vs. Execution
  * Are Objects _and_ executable procedures
  * Scope vs. Context
* Execution contexts ("Frames" in pythontutor)
 
Your brain will construct an understanding of how JS works whether or not you intentionally guide it, it's what brains do.  As great as this sounds it is really very dangerous.  JavaScript is complicated and it is very easy to come up with explanations that work for simple Codewars but are not accurate.  You won't notice at first, but as soon as you try to move on you will find it nearly impossible to understand what's going on.  Unlearning and relearning how JavaScript executes is very difficult and will take a lot of time.

To avoid this danger we provide you with the tools you need to intentionally build a correct N.M. from the beginning.  The two most important are:
1. Using pseudocode to draft your solutions before coding them. (Solution Process in the README)
2. Carefully stepping through your finished solutions with concrete examples. (/step-throughs)

So stick to it!  These exercises aren't very glamorous but they will set you up for long-term success.

## Specifications

The Process:
1. Choose an interesting code wars challenge
2. Copy the template repo
3. Add it to your portfolio
4. Fill out every blank in the template
5. Request a code review for your newly complete repository

This project never ends!  Set a goal to add 3+ Kata Repos to your gallery each week.

Whether you're struggling with 7 Kyu challenges or writing 1 Kyu challenges, completing these kata repos will help you up your game. So start a Codewars Gallery, put it on your portfolio, and keep it growing.
