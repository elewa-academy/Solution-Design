Then, write the code. ”  - John Johnson\n\nIn this project you will send you deep into problem solving and thinking with code.  Rather than solving as many challenges as possible, you'll be doing an in-depth study of fewer challenges.  Pick katas that interest you, this will help you power through.  \nAlong the way you'll learn about reading code, testing, using pseudocode, analyzing problem solving strategies, the JavaScript runtime execution, and much more.   \nIf this sounds like a lot, that's because it is.  Studying fewer problems in greater depth (and from many different angles) will lead to better skill transfer, better self-knowledge, and more dexterity when dealing directly with sourcecode.  \nDon't forget to build a gallery page for your Kata Repos and to feature it on your portfolio!\nIndex\n\nLearning Objectives\nSpecifications\nResources\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nThreshold Concepts in Programming:\nNotional machine\nProblem solving strategies\nTranslating strategies to code\nReading code\n\n\nUnderstand testing\nUsing pseudocode\nHandling repositories\nWriting about code\nNavigating GitHub & Source Code\nCode Reviews\n\nTOP\n\nSpecifications\nThe Process:\n\nAdd a Solution Design Gallery to your portfolio\nChoose an interesting CodeWars Kata and use it to follow the Solution Design Guide GitBook.

Exploration","keywords":"","body":"Exploration\nWhen presented with a new challenge, it is a waste of time to start by trying to solve it.  The moment you begin thinking of solutions, you limit your energies to debating or improving the proposed solutions rather than looking for new perspectives on the challenge.\nBefore even considering solutions, you should spend more time than you want to considering the challenge from every angle. This is also not intuitive, but a crucial skill to understand and practice.\nAs a developer, you are very rarely solving a challenge that has been exactly solved before (or you'd be using someone else's code).  You will rarely have much guidance.  You will often have have a lot of freedom in coming up with your solution.  This is not the best situation for creative challenge solving.\nYou must manage your time and your patience to maximize your efforts.  By spending extra time understanding the challenge then even more selecting the correct constraints for yourself, you will be saving yourself and your team time in the future.\n\n“Given one hour to save the world, I would spend 55 minutes defining the challenge and 5 minutes finding the solution.” ~ Albert Einstein\n\n\n\n\n"},"01-understand-the-challenge/":{"url":"01-understand-the-challenge/","title":"1.

Taking time now to intentionally explore the effect of different constraints on your development process will pay off in the future.  \nConstraints are much more than just extra challenges!  Well-selected constraints can help you: \n\nIncrease your creativity\nImprove the quality of your finished solution\nUnderstand challenges in new and unexpected ways\nLearn new things from old or easy challenges\nPractice dealing with common & realistic scenarios\nFocus in on particular techniques, tools, or language features\nImprove project estimation skills\n\n\nConstraint Suggestions\nAt the beginning of your programming journey choosing helpful constraints will be very challenging, and you're already constrained enough by your lack of experience.  There's no reason to go wild placing extra difficulties in your way.  That said, there is one constraint we suggest that will help you develop good habits from the beginning:\n\nThink of your functions as return-value photo copiers.\n\nThis isn't as challenging as it sounds and may even help by productively limiting your choices.  Here's a few pointers for building this kind of function:\n\nInitialize your function scaffold with the right type of return value at the top\nInitialize your function scaffold by returning the empty return value\nThe main task of your function will be to build this empty value into a complete value before returning it\nNever modify your arguments, they should only ever appear on the right hand side of an assignment.  (ie. No matter where in your function you console.log and argument, it will always be the same.)\n(Read through Lodash to see this constraint in action.)\n\nMore advanced constraint possibilities:\n\nWork with only certain language features\nAvoid certain language features\nPlace a time limit on yourself\nUse a new library, like Lodash\nWrite the fewest lines of code you can\nMake your function use the fewest steps possible (as measured by PythonTutor)\n... and so many more!\n\n\n\n\n"},"08-estimate-resources/":{"url":"08-estimate-resources/","title":"8.

We find there are two very important rules that will help you keep a clear head:\n\nUse cognitive tools like clear code, good habits, useful diagrams, careful planning, and isolation techniques to lighten the load on your working memory.\nDon't work on anything you can't hold in your head all at once.\nIf you find there's too much going to keep straight, you probably did a bad job with # 1.\n\n\n\nBuilding a scaffold for your solution before attempting to pass any tests will go a long way towards lightening your mental workload. A well-designed scaffold will:\n\nPromote breaking down large challenges into smaller ones\nIsolate independent elements of your solution\nGuarantee your solution has the right structure\nDefend against certain types of logic bugs\nEnable you to break up your work time without losing track of where you are\nWriting readable solutions\nEncourage good design habits by committing to them ahead of time\nPrepare you for TDD\n\nDesigning your scaffolding is tricky, it will require time and experience before you can expect to do it quickly. Here are a few suggestions to get you started:\n\nDevelop your scaffolding in a Gist, adding a new file for each iteration.\nBegin by naming your function, writing in all arguments, declaring an empty return value, and returning the empty value.\nBuild your scaffolding in small steps, converting your solution pseudocode into real code whenever you can.\nYour scaffolding will consist largely of control flow (ie. loops, conditionals, and short procedures)\nStop each time you have isolated the lines of code that will implement a test category.

These notional machines don't need to be precise down to the physical chips, instead they need to accurately describe what is relevant to the task at hand.
