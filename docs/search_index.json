Then, write the code. ”  - John Johnson\n\nIn this project you will send you deep into problem solving and thinking with code.  Rather than solving as many challenges as possible, you'll be doing an in-depth study of fewer challenges.  Pick katas that interest you, this will help you power through.  \nAlong the way you'll learn about reading code, testing, using pseudocode, analyzing problem solving strategies, the JavaScript runtime execution, and much more.   \nIf this sounds like a lot, that's because it is.  Studying fewer problems in greater depth (and from many different angles) will lead to better skill transfer, better self-knowledge, and more dexterity when dealing directly with sourcecode.  \nDon't forget to build a gallery page for your Kata Repos and to feature it on your portfolio!\nIndex\n\nLearning Objectives\nSpecifications\nResources\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nThreshold Concepts in Programming:\nNotional machine\nProblem solving strategies\nTranslating strategies to code\nReading code\n\n\nUnderstand testing\nUsing pseudocode\nHandling repositories\nWriting about code\nNavigating GitHub & Source Code\nCode Reviews\n\nTOP\n\nSpecifications\nThe Process:\n\nAdd a Solution Design Gallery to your portfolio\nChoose an interesting CodeWars Kata and use it to follow the Solution Design Guide GitBook.

Taking time now to intentionally explore the effect of different constraints on your development process will pay off in the future.  \nConstraints are much more than just extra challenges!  Well-selected constraints can help you: \n\nIncrease your creativity\nImprove the quality of your finished solution\nUnderstand challenges in new and unexpected ways\nLearn new things from old or easy challenges\nPractice dealing with common & realistic scenarios\nFocus in on particular techniques, tools, or language features\nImprove project estimation skills\n\n\nConstraint Suggestions\nAt the beginning of your programming journey choosing helpful constraints will be very challenging, and you're already constrained enough by your lack of experience.  There's no reason to go wild placing extra difficulties in your way.  That said, there is one constraint we suggest that will help you develop good habits from the beginning:\n\nThink of your functions as return-value factories.\n\nThis isn't as challenging as it sounds and may even help by productively limiting your choices.  Here's a few pointers for building this kind of function:\n\nInitialize your function scaffold with the right type of return value at the top\nInitialize your function scaffold by returning the empty return value\nThe main task of your function will be to build this empty value into a complete value before returning it\nNever modify your arguments, they should only ever appear on the right hand side of an assignment.  (ie. No matter where in your function you console.log and argument, it will always be the same.)\n\nMore advanced constraint possibilities:\n\nWork with only certain language features\nAvoid certain language features\nPlace a time limit on yourself\nUse a new library, like Lodash\nWrite the fewest lines of code you can\nMake your function use the fewest steps possible (as measured by PythonTutor)\n... and so many more!\n\n\n\n\n"},"08-estimate-resources/":{"url":"08-estimate-resources/","title":"8.

Even more importantly, writing out your process will help you generalize your problem solving skills - taking them from the world of coding small challenges to the world of application development.\nIf you find yourself getting stuck or having trouble understanding just what you're supposed to do, try taking a few simple examples inputs and solving them by hand.

Being able to step through code in your mind is one of the key skills that separates beginner programmers from experts. Carefully filling out your step-through markdowns is the most effective way to build this skill-set.\n\nJS Notional Machine\nThe notional machine is a mental model your brain builds to understand what JavaScript does during program execution.  These notional machines don't need to be precise down to the physical chips, instead they need to accurately describe what is relevant to the task at hand. At the beginning this list includes:\n\nHow JS steps through a file\nSource code vs. runtime application\nVariable initialization & reassignment\nFunctions: \nDefinition vs. Execution\nAre Objects and executable procedures\nScope vs. Context\n\n\nExecution contexts (\"Frames\" in pythontutor)\n\nYour brain will construct an understanding of how JS works whether or not you intentionally guide it, it's what brains do.  As great as this sounds it is really very dangerous.  JavaScript is complicated and it is very easy to come up with explanations that work for simple Codewars but are not accurate.  You won't notice at first, but as soon as you try to move on you will find it nearly impossible to understand what's going on.  Unlearning and relearning how JavaScript executes is very difficult and will take a lot of time.\nSo stick to it!
