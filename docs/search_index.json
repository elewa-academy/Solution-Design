All you need is a beginner's familiarity with JavaScript.  If you apply yourself to this curriculum you will be able to learn all the important stuff right away without getting lost on the internet or forming any bad habits. \nSo don't be shy, give it a shot!

Carefully filling out your step-through markdowns is the most effective way to build this skill-set.\n\nJS Notional Machine\nThe notional machine is a mental model your brain builds to understand what JavaScript does during program execution.  These notional machines don't need to be precise down to the physical chips, instead they need to accurately describe what is relevant to the task at hand. At the beginning this list includes:\n\nHow JS steps through a file\nSource code vs. runtime application\nVariable initialization & reassignment\nFunctions: \nDefinition vs. Execution\nAre Objects and executable procedures\nScope vs. Context\n\n\nExecution contexts (\"Frames\" in pythontutor)\n\nYour brain will construct an understanding of how JS works whether or not you intentionally guide it, it's what brains do.  As great as this sounds it is really very dangerous.  JavaScript is complicated and it is very easy to come up with explanations that work for simple Codewars but are not accurate.  You won't notice at first, but as soon as you try to move on you will find it nearly impossible to understand what's going on.  Unlearning and relearning how JavaScript executes is very difficult and will take a lot of time.\nSo stick to it!  This step isn't very glamorous but it will set you up for long-term success.\n\n\n\n"},"14-study-other-solutions/":{"url":"14-study-other-solutions/","title":"14.
