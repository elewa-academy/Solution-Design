# Scaffold Your Solution


use gists
	create new file in gist for each new bit of scaffolding
try to isolate sets of test cases with your scaffolding
think of your function as a return value factory
	- this will take some time
	initialize empty at top of function
	build solution it in stages
	return it at the end
	think of arguments as read-only
steps
	function, args & return values
